I was trying to think of a better name for a Strawberry Posset (which is what this actually is), but since very few people know what that is, I am calling it a Strawberry Dream. I think you'll agree that the name is totally appropriate. The boiled strawberry-infused cream and sugar filling firms up into a pudding-like texture, that when sandwiched between strawberry puree and macerated strawberries, tastes like a dream! Even though the portions are a bit small, the taste is rich and a little goes a long way.",
